# hubot-github-webhook-listener 

A [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/) script to that makes it easy to consume [Github Webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/).

## Installation

From your hubot folder:
`npm install --save hub-github-webhook-listener`

Then, in your `external-scripts.json` file, add: `"hubot-github-webhook-listener"` to the list.

Create a new webhook for your `myuser/myrepo` repository at:
https://github.com/myuser/myrepo/settings/hooks/new
Set the webhook url to: &lt;HUBOT_URL&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;/hubot/github-repo-listener

For example, if your hubot lives at myhubot.herokuapp.com, then you will set the webhook URL to: http://myhubot.herokuapp.com/hubot/github-repo-listener

## Usage

On every incoming webhook message, a hubot event is emitted as follows

```coffeescript
eventBody =
  eventType   : req.headers["x-github-event"]
  signature   : req.headers["X-Hub-Signature"]
  deliveryId  : req.headers["X-Github-Delivery"]
  payload     : req.body
  query       : querystring.parse(url.parse(req.url).query)

robot.emit "github-repo-event", eventBody
```

For details on these fields, see the [Github Webhook documentation](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/).

**SECURITY WARNING**: This script does not currently validate the Github Secret to verify that the webhook came from Github. So, if someone knows the URL to your Hubot, they can spoof webhooks and issue your Hubot commands. So, for now be careful about exposing commands like `destroy company`, etc. I plan to validate these webhooks soon. In the meantime, patches are welcome. :)

You can consume it like so from one of your scripts:
```coffeescript
@robot.on "github-repo-event", (repo_event) =>
  githubPayload = repo_event.payload
  switch(repo_event.eventType)
    when "issue_comment"
      ...
```

NOTE: This script does not emit anything in chat. It is just a background task that makes consuming Github webhooks easier for other scripts.

For another example, see our [Hubot-Github adapter](https://github.com/ynab/hubot-github) that gives you a hubot in your Github issue comments.

## Motivation

I was using [hubot-github-repo-event-notifier](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-github-repo-event-notifier), but I needed something more generic to power our hubot-github adapter. So, I gutted it, and this script was born.

## Local Testing

For easy local testing, I highly recommend ngrok: https://ngrok.com/

1. Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
2. run ngrok: `ngrok 8080`.
  It will show you a public URL like: `Forwarding  https://7a008da9.ngrok.com -> 127.0.0.1:8080`
3. Put that URL in as your Github webhook: `https://7a008da9.ngrok.com/hubot/github-repo-listener`
4. Run hubot locally: `HUBOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=some_log_guid bin/hubot -a github --name Hubot`
5. Fire off a github event by interacting with your repo. Comment on an issue or a PR for example.
6. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4040/`
  There you can see all webhooks posted to your local machine, and can replay them as many times as you wish.
