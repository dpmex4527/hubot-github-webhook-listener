# Description:
#   Listens for github webhooks and emits an event for other Hubot scripts to respond to.
#   Inspired _heavily_ (with some verbatim copying) by hubot-github-repo-event-notifier
#
# Configuration:
#
#   1. Create a new webhook for your `myuser/myrepo` repository at:
#      https://github.com/myuser/myrepo/settings/hooks/new
#      Set the webhook url to: <HUBOT_URL>:<PORT>/hubot/github-repo-listener[?param1=value1&param2=value2]
#
#   Incoming webhooks are emitted as events with the name github-repo-event
#   The body of the event is:
#      {
#          eventType,   # The name of the event
#          data,        # The full parsed object body of the posted event
#          query        # The parsed query string of the posted event
#      }
# Commands:
#   None
#
# URLS:
#   POST /hubot/github-repo-listener[?param1=value1&param2=value2]
#
# Notes:
#   For easy local testing, I highly recommend ngrok: https://ngrok.com/
#   1. Install ngrok
#   2. run ngrok: `ngrok 8080`.
#      It will show you a public URL like: `Forwarding  https://7a008da9.ngrok.com -> 127.0.0.1:8080`
#   3. Put that URL in as your Github webhook: `https://7a008da9.ngrok.com/hubot/github-repo-listener`
#   4. Run hubot locally: `HUBOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=some_log_guid bin/hubot -a github --name Hubot`
#   5. Fire off a github event by interacting with your repo. Comment on an issue or a PR for example.
#   6. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4040/`
#      There you can see all webhooks posted to your local machine, and can replay them as many times as you wish.
